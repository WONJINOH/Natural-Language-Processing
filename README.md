## Architecture Progression

```
RNN Basics → Seq2Seq + Attention → Transformer → Applications (Translation, Chatbot)
```

The projects follow a natural progression from foundational sequence models to the Transformer architecture and its practical applications in machine translation and dialogue systems.
